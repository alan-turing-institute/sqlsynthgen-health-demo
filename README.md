## Credits

The Indian Liver Patient Records was downloaded [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records/code). 
And the project's code organisation was inspired by Joshua Cook's [excellent book on Docker for Data Science](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Docker-Data-Science-Extensible-Infrastructure/dp/1484230116).
